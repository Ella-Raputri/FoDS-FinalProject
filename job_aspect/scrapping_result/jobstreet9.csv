Learning and lots of it. We promote vertical and lateral movement. It’s not uncommon for Tayo (that’s what we call our team) to move divisions two or three times throughout their career. We want people to learn new stuff that excites them. 
Sincere teamwork. This word isn’t officially in our values, but when I asked new joiners about what value they really feel at Tada that’s not stated on our wall, many mentioned that Tayo is really helpful and they can feel the ‘teamwork’ atmosphere
