Deskripsi Perusahaan
The Bank was established on 27 April 1971 under the name of PT Bank Pasar Pagi Madju. In line with the change in its status from a retail banking to a commercial bank in 1989, the Bank’s name was changed into PT Bank Bintang Manunggal (Bank Bima). This status change had a positive impact on the Bank’s performance and succeeded in attracting Hana Financial Group to take over the majority of the Bank’s shares. The change in the Shareholders was followed by a change in its name into PT Bank Hana. In 2013, PT Bank Hana took a strategic action by merging with PT Bank KEB Indonesia to create synergies in the banking business. This business activity caused the Bank to change its name to PT Bank KEB Hana Indonesia or known as Bank KEB Hana. However, in 2020, Bank KEB Hana yet again made a brand change to Bank Hana. By these changes, Hana Bank is increasingly ready to strengthen its competitiveness, both in Indonesia and globally, through the consistency of the brands used by the group. With the presence of its best people, Hana Bank provides an array of products and services designed to meet various customer needs. Given its global reach and global standard of service, Hana Bank promises its customers to be their True Hearted Financial Partner.","['C++', 'Java', 'Ruby', 'C', 'PHP', 'SQL', 'MySQL']"

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most exciting of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.
We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).
We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

sustainable energy transition in indonesia (seti) senior project lead,WRI Indonesia,Jakarta,13931335.897959184,Full-time,"Program Overview
The Sustainable Energy Transition in Indonesia (SETI) Project has the main objective to support Indonesia’s energy transition by increasing the share of renewable energy and improving the energy efficiency of key industries, as well as the built environment. To achieve this, SETI follows a multi-level approach that focuses on the demand perspective: it demonstrates innovative technologies and business cases to encourage private sector actors to replicate successful renewable energy and energy efficiency approaches in industry. This is accompanied by improving the readiness of financial instruments for sustainable energy investments. Through piloting integrated energy planning and its implementation on the municipal level, SETI will also bring the topic of decarbonization to the sub-national level. Finally, SETI loops back results, lessons learned, and experiences to the national level to design a relevant and fertile policy framework.

SETI is implemented through a consortium of Indonesian and international implementing partners, consisting of GIZ, WRI Indonesia, IESR, and Yayasan Indonesia Cerah. Anchored with the Direktorat Jenderal Energi Baru Terbarukan dan Konservasi Energi (DJ EBTKE) under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), SETI works with different energy-related political partners, including Bappenas, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, PLN, to name a few.

As one of the consortium members and implementing partners, WRI Indonesia’s main task is to plan and execute activities for Output 3 (Industry Innovation Lab), as well as taking over the responsibility for achieving the respective impacts by collaborating with the Government of Indonesia stakeholders, as well with other relevant stakeholders like the Kadin Net Zero Hub (Kadin NZH), industrial estate(s), companies, and business associations. WRI will also coordinate and support the SETI consortium in some activities of Output 1 (Policy), 2 (Finance), and 4 (Urban Energy Lab).

Under its Energy and Sustainable Business portfolio, WRI Indonesia has been closely working to drive the adoption of transformative business models, develop net-zero business supporting ecosystem, and empower businesses to achieve net-zero targets. WRI contributes to the industrial decarbonization space by developing research, decarbonization strategy tools, climate innovation, and evidence-based policy recommendations, as well as leading two flagship initiatives, which are: (i) The Kadin Net Zero Hub (Kadin NZH), a knowledge hub to assist companies affiliated with Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) on their path to net-zero emissions, and (ii) the Clean Energy Investment Accelerator (CEIA), to advance policies and financing for clean energy in the commercial and industrial sectors

Job Highlight
The Senior Project Lead is responsible for managing the SETI’s project implementation and ensuring that all outputs are delivered at the highest quality by the end of the project timeline. The position holder is expected to collaborate with other relevant cluster teams within the same deputyship of Climate, Energy, Cities, and Ocean to ensure alignment of research, engagement, and other project activities. Engagement with external stakeholders, such as the SETI’s consortium members, companies, business associations, and other relevant stakeholders is also required to ensure the success of the project.

This position will be based in Jakarta, with the possibility of doing travel. This position will report to the Senior Manager for Energy and Sustainable Business.

#WeAreCisco. We are all unique, but collectively we bring our talents to work as a team, to develop innovative technology and power a more inclusive, digital future for everyone. How do we do it? Well, for starters – with people like you!

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way.

Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

As Asia's largest licensed digital securities exchange for alternative investments, Alta is at the forefront of building critical capital market infrastructure. We believe that access to capital markets are pivotal in all economies, we recognize that our role in building this critical infrastructure goes beyond facilitating trades; it paves the way for entrepreneurship, job creation, financial inclusion, and economic resilience, fostering a brighter future for emerging markets and economies.

Innovative Financial Ecosystem: Our journey has seen us transition from securities trading and distribution of comprehensive products, including equities, private credit, funds, and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) (representing Real World Assets (""RWA"") like whiskies, wines, art, watches, and real estate) to include fund management and digital custody services.
As the only integrated securities exchange, brokerage, and fund management group with the necessary regulatory licenses and a proven track record in Southeast Asia, we are actively exploring new channels and partnerships to extend our impact to entrepreneurs and investors globally.
