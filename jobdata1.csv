Atomic is growing a diverse and inclusive team of curious, creative people who love creating great software for our clients.
We're looking for thoughtful problem solvers who are passionate about development.
The Role
Atomic Accelerators work on self-managed teams of 2-10 software developers. They collaborate alongside our designers, delivery leads, and testers to create products for our clients, from the idea phase through launch and beyond. Teams are project-based, so you'll get to work with new people and tackle new challenges approximately every 6-12 months.
As a software developer at Atomic, most of your time will be spent writing code alongside other Atoms. But your role isn’t limited to technical responsibilities. Atomic promises clients a great experience and a great product. Software developers deliver on that promise by being kind, curious, positive individuals who provide excellent high-level technical advice to a diverse set of clients.
Requirements
Applicants should be working toward graduating with a Computer Science or related Bachelor's degree, recently graduated with a Computer Science degree, or a graduate of a non-C.S. program who has completed a coding bootcamp with the intention to transition to a career in software development.
Applicants must be willing and able to work in person from our office in Grand Rapids, MI.
The Company
Since 2001, Atomic Object has created custom software products for web, mobile, desktop, and internet-connected devices. We were founded on the belief that not all software is created equal. Many people can write code, but it takes a close-knit team of passionate people to create exceptional, innovative products that change the way people do business.
We’re an employee-owned company and a certified B Corporation with 90+ Atoms based in our Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, Chicago, and Raleigh offices. With over 20 years of experience delivering custom software, we offer far more job stability than your average tech startup. Yet our distributed small offices and flat org structure provide a close-knit, personable workplace with no corporate ladder to climb.

Atomic Object has a strategic goal to strengthen our company and the broader tech industry by increasing our employee diversity, pushing for and enacting more equitable and antiracist policies and practices.
