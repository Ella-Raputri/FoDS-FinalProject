Indonesia. We are also the first digital bank on the cloud. As the first profitable digital bank, we
managed to get listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange.

How did we manage to do that?

We are changing people’s perception of a bank. We believe we are the innovators who combine
customer focus principles with creating technology-based impact. We incorporate freedom and
flexibility as part of our startup working culture DNA to encourage innovation in creating better
financial solutions for the banking industry. We think of ourselves as, ‘A technology company
with a banking license’. For this reason, we ‘Act like a FinTech, and think like a Bank.’

How did it all start?

Founded on March 15, 1991, in Surabaya as PT Anglomas International Bank (Amin Bank), the
bank was acquired by Tolaram Group and transformed to PT Bank Amar Indonesia (Amar Bank)
in 2014. It has then undergone a significant digital transformation to become one of the
country's forerunning fintech institutions through its award-winning digital lending platform,
Tunaiku.

Our philosophy, mission, and vision

Technology must impact lives, must improve lives. We exist to provide banking to those who
‘need’ and not only to those who ‘want’. Services when provided to those who need at the time
of their need brings smiles. Our vision is to bring 200 million smiles.

Program Background

The SKALA Program is a significant Australian investment designed to help Indonesia address regional disparities in development. SKALA will contribute to this objective by strengthening selected elements of Indonesia's large and complex decentralised government system responsible for the delivery of basic services (Layanan Dasar). The SKALA Program's core approach is to facilitate better collaboration (Kolaborasi) between Indonesian government stakeholders, at national and subnational levels, to help realise synergies (Sinergi) that will trigger improved service delivery. Moreover, SKALA will build on, and take to scale, the successes and learning from Australia's previous 19 years of support to Indonesia's decentralised government system. The SKALA Program is to be implemented through the following three pillars:
Pillar 1: Stronger national level enabling environment for sub-national service delivery
Pillar 2: Better sub-national governance for service delivery
Pillar 3: Greater participation, representation and influence for women, people with disabilities and vulnerable groups

SKALA is implemented at the national level with an office in Jakarta and at the subnational level with offices in Aceh, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Maluku, Gorontalo, Kalimantan Utara (Kaltara), Tanah Papua. In addition to the 3 pillars, SKALA works across 4 general themes of Public Financial Management, Minimum Service Standards, Data and Analysis and Gender Equality, Disability and Social Inclusion (GEDSI).

"Sustainable Energy Transition in Indonesia (SETI) Senior Project Lead

The Sustainable Energy Transition in Indonesia (SETI) Project has the main objective to support Indonesia’s energy transition by increasing the share of renewable energy and improving the energy efficiency of key industries, as well as the built environment. To achieve this, SETI follows a multi-level approach that focuses on the demand perspective: it demonstrates innovative technologies and business cases to encourage private sector actors to replicate successful renewable energy and energy efficiency approaches in industry. This is accompanied by improving the readiness of financial instruments for sustainable energy investments. Through piloting integrated energy planning and its implementation on the municipal level, SETI will also bring the topic of decarbonization to the sub-national level. Finally, SETI loops back results, lessons learned, and experiences to the national level to design a relevant and fertile policy framework.

SETI is implemented through a consortium of Indonesian and international implementing partners, consisting of GIZ, WRI Indonesia, IESR, and Yayasan Indonesia Cerah. Anchored with the Direktorat Jenderal Energi Baru Terbarukan dan Konservasi Energi (DJ EBTKE) under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MEMR), SETI works with different energy-related political partners, including Bappenas, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, PLN, to name a few.

WRI contributes to the industrial decarbonization space by developing research, decarbonization strategy tools, climate innovation, and evidence-based policy recommendations, as well as leading two flagship initiatives, which are: (i) The Kadin Net Zero Hub (Kadin NZH), a knowledge hub to assist companies affiliated with Indonesia's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) on their path to net-zero emissions, and (ii) the Clean Energy Investment Accelerator (CEIA), to advance policies and financing for clean energy in the commercial and industrial sectors

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way.

Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

We believe that access to capital markets are pivotal in all economies, we recognize that our role in building this critical infrastructure goes beyond facilitating trades; it paves the way for entrepreneurship, job creation, financial inclusion, and economic resilience, fostering a brighter future for emerging markets and economies.
Empowering Private Markets: Through our Digital Exchange, we enable the tokenization and digital custody of alternative assets. This end-to-end solution simplifies and expedites the trading of smaller asset blocks, ultimately facilitating access and liquidity in private markets.
Innovative Financial Ecosystem: Our journey has seen us transition from securities trading and distribution of comprehensive products, including equities, private credit, funds, and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) (representing Real World Assets (""RWA"") like whiskies, wines, art, watches, and real estate) to include fund management and digital custody services.
As the only integrated securities exchange, brokerage, and fund management group with the necessary regulatory licenses and a proven track record in Southeast Asia, we are actively exploring new channels and partnerships to extend our impact to entrepreneurs and investors globally.
Established in 2016 and headquartered in Singapore, Alta operates offices globally. We welcome energetic and creative individuals to be part of this ambitious journey with us.
About The Role
As a Senior Software Engineer at Alta, you will have the opportunity to leverage your extensive full-stack software skills in a modern and rapidly evolving development environment, while also being deeply integrated into a broader team that’s on the leading edge of financial innovation. Blockchain, DeFi, API/service-driven architectures, serverless infrastructure, data pipelines, front-end frameworks and no-code platforms are all key elements of our technological ecosystem that you will be exposed to.
‍
At Alta, we are developing a suite of platforms and services that form the backbone of our operations. Brokerage: A rich and evolving web experience designed to cater to diverse investors, focusing on alternative assets across all classes through insightful, data-driven dashboards and deep asset analysis. Back-Office Operations Platform: A robust platform that integrates with numerous third-party service providers in KYC, payments, and settlement, along with ready integration with our internal systems to streamline operations across various departments. Exchange: A modern, digital-first asset exchange aimed at rapid API-driven trades, providing member firms with readily accessible market data through API integrations or direct UI access. Custody: An adaptable and scalable approach to digital asset tokenization, offering agnostic support across various asset classes and blockchains, coupled with a hybrid ledger for seamless custodial operations. As a Senior Engineer, you will play a crucial role in building and shaping these applications. ‍
As a senior engineer, both hands-on development and technical leadership are big parts of the job. You’ll be a key technical stakeholder in our feature planning process, helping to map complex business requirements to technical solutions and offering your ideas and opinions. You’ll have extensive opportunities to mentor more junior members of the team, and will contribute significantly to ensuring we continue to hire the best engineering talent to the team. We build quickly but carefully – the security and privacy of our investors and partners is paramount, so you’ll be keeping these front-of-mind throughout all of the work that you do.
‍
We’re a supportive, social, and entrepreneurial team of former investment bankers, technologists and strategists. Clear, honest communication is key to everything we do.

As our Senior Software Engineer, we know you’ll be doing significant learning on the job. That said, we’re hoping you’ll bring:
5+ years of software engineering experience
Strong experience in multiple object-oriented and/or functional programming languages. We’re language-agnostic in our hiring, but have JavaScript/Node, Rails, Python and others in our ecosystem stack
A strong sense of what it takes to build a scalable, secure and cloud-native application architecture
Able to choose the right coding pattern for the job, including around building easily testable code (if not via pure TDD, at least leveraging those principles)

Strong code review habits, leading by example on being proactive and constructive with comments and conversations among your peers
Excellent knowledge data modeling in both relational and non-relational databases

Beyond the technology, we also hope you’ve got some interest in:

An appreciation for experimentation and designing systems/processes that accommodate business and technical agility
