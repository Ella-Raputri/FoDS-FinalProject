Regularly assess and mitigate risks related to schedules, pipelines, and team morale. Provide proactive solutions and adjustments as needed.
Scope & Schedule Management: Accommodate and communicate changes in project scope, schedule, and learnings in a fast-paced Agile environment. Ensure that all changes are managed effectively.
Cross-Team & Stakeholder Communication: Foster effective communication among team members working on multiple projects across different time zones and locations (in person and virtual). Ensure all team members are aligned and informed. Communicate with management and key stakeholders about risks, mitigations, opportunities, and challenges in a dynamic environment.
