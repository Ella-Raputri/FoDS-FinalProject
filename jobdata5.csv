Coinbase,"At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn’t do this without hiring the best people. We’re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they’re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That’s us.
There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Most importantly, we seek people who are excited about crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We’re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.
Who you are:
You’ve got positive energy. You’re optimistic about the future and determined to get there.
You’re never tired of learning. You want to be a pro in bleeding edge tech like DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and Web 3.0.
You appreciate direct communication. You’re both an active communicator and an eager listener - because let’s face it, you can’t have one without the other. You’re cool with candid feedback and see every setback as an opportunity to grow.
You can pivot on the fly. Crypto is constantly evolving, so our priorities do, too. What you worked on last month may not be what you work on today, and that excites you. You’re not looking for a boring job.
You have a “can do” attitude. Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn’t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.
You want to be part of a winning team. We’re stronger together, and you’re a person who embraces being pushed out of your comfort zone.
The mission of the Platform Product Group engineers is to build a trusted, scalable and compliant platform to operate with speed, efficiency and quality.

We are the swiss-army knife that works very closely with teams all across the stack, building trust in Coinbase as a service and in the crypto ecosystem as a whole.

This position is within the Orchestration and Processing pod, developing background jobs. It is almost impossible to overstate the role this team plays within Coinbase, since almost every service requires asynchronous processing capabilities. Every small victory achieved by the team has huge implications for cost, security, etc. The aim of this team is to abstract away this layer of complexity, building modern reliable, scalable, fault-tolerant, performant jobs that other teams can “fire and forget”. It is a great opportunity to build a foundational product that is widely used.

What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):
Oversee the tools used to orchestrate background jobs at Coinbase.
Support critical user journeys like trading, adding and withdrawing funds and much more.
Run Temporal and our internal background jobs service across Coinbase.
What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):
You have at least 5+ years of software engineering experience.

Who you are:
Our culture is much deeper than just having fun together (though we do that well, too). We take pride in our engineers being trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence.

You have experience in hiring and conducting interviews.
You have 5+ years of software development engineering experience.
You have a Bachelor's/Master's level degree in computer science or relevant engineering-related field or equivalent experience. Not everyone has the same level of access to opportunities. What is most important to us is what and how you can contribute, which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have.
You have additional nice-to-have experience in the following areas:
Proficiency with a modern language such as C# or Java or Golang or Python
Experience working in large codebases, organizing and refactoring
Experience with configuration management
Experience with continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
Experience with configuration and management in cloud / virtualization environments (AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, et al)
Experience with using or extending ArgoCD, Argo Rollouts, Spinnaker, or any cloud native CI/CD platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP)

A variety of technical opportunities is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a software engineer, which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and find solutions to complex problems using the optimum tools for the job. What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We are not seeking engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent answers no one has thought of yet and find answers to the questions yet to be asked."

About Wealthfront

Wealthfront started with the ambition to transform the investment advisory business, with the goal to unlock access to high quality investment advice for millions who were underserved by the traditional institutions. We built one of the first automated investment products that allows you to invest in a personalized portfolio of thousands of companies in seconds for a remarkably low fee. We then expanded. We now work with partner banks to offer exceptional banking features through a Wealthfront Brokerage Cash Account, which makes it remarkably easy for people to automate their finances end-to-end and eliminated the hassle of money management, all of which resulted in attracting more than $70 billion of our client’s hard earned money, pioneering the robo-advisor category and transforming the broader industry. And yet, we have a long way to go to achieve our mission to build a financial system that favors people, not institutions.

Wealthfront’s vision is to make it delightfully easy to build long-term wealth on your own terms. This vision is more relevant than ever because millions more people are getting into the market early and investing their hard earned savings in a handful of stocks. While this is a great way to start, it is inconsistent with building long-term wealth. We want to empower young investors to expand their horizon, and easily explore and execute on a wider range of investing strategies, make informed investment decisions that are consistent with their values and beliefs while also making it effortless to grow and compound their savings exponentially in a way that’s transformational to their lives and their long-term future.
