 ROLE OVERVIEW
 The Full Stack engineer will be responsible for developing, securing, and scaling our large and complex hotel management platform.  This role’s focus will be to develop, maintain, and continually improve our full-stack SaaS platform, based on PHP, Laravel, Code Ignitor and Vue.
Our Full Stack engineers need to be very detail-oriented, with organizational and problem-solving skills, plus the ability to communicate clearly with all departments, from engineers to the CEO.

Develop new features to support our rapidly growing business
Assume leadership of new projects, from conceptualization to deployment

 Character
We’re a tight-knit team. Every one of us genuinely loves what we do; we love KYC and we’re in this to win for the right reasons- we want to create a happier world through happier travelers and yes, we each have our unique set of life goals that we hope KYC can enable us to achieve. Most importantly, we are a team that places utmost priority on mutual respect, kindness and empathy. We have zero tolerance for disrespectful and inappropriate behavior, crass language, laziness, lack of integrity.  We’re searching for decent human beings who believe in good old fashioned hard work and earning success through ethical behavior. We respect people who have strong beliefs but who can communicate their thoughts and ideas respectfully and thoroughly AND are humble enough to admit when they’re wrong or that a colleague’s method may be better.
 Passion For Luxury Hotels and Travel
You must have a fundamental grasp of the business of luxury hotels and luxury brands or at the very least, have a huge desire to learn about this and be able to do so quickly by working closely with our CEO. You must love travel (though your position does not require traveling) and understand why travelers are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for certain luxury hotel and travel experiences.
 Passion for Food
You must love food. If you don’t have a huge passion for food, you probably won’t get along with any of us. 
 COMPENSATION & PERKS
Work from home most of the time and avoid wasting your life in traffic. Our team meets an average of 2 days per month. The exceptions are 1) when you’re onboarding we’ll need to meet with you 3-5 days in a row and 2) when we’re onboarding a major client or releasing critical features, our Team may need to meet more frequently.
On the days we meet, all meals we have together are paid for and we’re serious food lovers so we eat well. Parking (metered or garage) is reimbursed.
Whenever we have social gatherings, your families (wives, husbands, partners, children, parents) are welcome and encouraged (event appropriate), hosted by us. Our style of “social” means:
Dinners at restaurants like Narisawa
Wine, Beer and Sake tastings 
Penthouse tours of luxury Hotels
Afternoon tea at luxury Hotels
Spa Days at luxury Hotels
Overnight Trips at luxury Hotels
Culinary classes
Afternoon tea at luxury Hotels
Stay in the world’s most awesome Hotels from mid-tier to luxury.
One on one time with our CEO monthly so you gain a deeper understanding of the Hotel business; have the opportunity to grow as a leader (if this is of interest to you).
Arguably the most important perk- genuine respect and caring from the entire team. We jokingly look at ourselves as Ocean’s Eleven; we’re a team of widely differing backgrounds, characters and areas of expertise who all share the vision of growing KYC into a world class behemoth and finding joy every step of the journey. Once you’re hired, you’re part of our family.
