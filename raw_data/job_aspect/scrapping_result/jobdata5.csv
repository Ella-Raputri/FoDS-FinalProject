"Software Engineer (Junior/Fresh Graduate)
- job post",Argus Labs,Jakarta,None,Full-time,"Argus Labs is building the next generation of massively multiplayer online (MMO) games by empowering players with the extensive freedom to build, extend, and influence the game worlds they inhabit. Our approach is centered around World Engine, our state-of-the-art onchain game server framework.

World Engine leverages a novel sharded rollup blockchain architecture, which allows games to use smart contracts for user-generated content (UGC) while scaling to tens of thousands of concurrent users without compromising performance. To date, World Engine is the most performant blockchain designed from the ground up for games and has been used in production for games like Dark Frontier, processing 700K+ player transactions within a week.
Backed by the best
We raised $10 million in seed funding led by Haun Ventures ($1.5B crypto fund led by former a16z GP, Katie Haun) with participation from influential angel investors in tech and gaming such as Elad Gil and Balaji Srinivasan (ex-Coinbase CTO).

"Software Engineer (Junior/Fresh Graduate)
- job post",Argus Labs,Jakarta,None,Full-time,"Argus Labs is building the next generation of massively multiplayer online (MMO) games by empowering players with the extensive freedom to build, extend, and influence the game worlds they inhabit. Our approach is centered around World Engine, our state-of-the-art onchain game server framework.

World Engine leverages a novel sharded rollup blockchain architecture, which allows games to use smart contracts for user-generated content (UGC) while scaling to tens of thousands of concurrent users without compromising performance. To date, World Engine is the most performant blockchain designed from the ground up for games and has been used in production for games like Dark Frontier, processing 700K+ player transactions within a week.

Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40
Overview
You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!
What Will I Be Doing?
Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Verilog code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""
Pay Rates
Compensation rates vary based on location and experience.
Note: The following rates are starting points and may be subject to change:

US - 50/hr
Brazil - 25.40 USD /hr
Egypt - 14.60 USD /hr
Philippines - 24.20 USD /hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.
Contract Length
Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.
You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.
Flexible Schedules
Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.
You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.
Interview Process
Apply using this Ashby form.
If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.
You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.
You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.

US - 50/hr
Brazil - 25.40 USD /hr
Egypt - 14.60 USD /hr
Philippines - 24.20 USD /hr
Expectations are 15+ hours per week; however, there is no upper limit. We have engineers working 20-40 hours per week and some working 40+ hours per week. You can work as much as you want to. You'll get paid weekly per hour of work done on the platform.
Contract Length
Long term, there is no end date. They expect to have work for the next 2 years.
You can end the contract at any time. We hope you will commit to 12 months of work, but if you start and it's not a fit for you, we totally understand.
Flexible Schedules
Developers can set their own hours—ideal candidates will be interested in spending 40 hours a week. They will be with teams, so strong performers will adapt to the urgency of projects and stay engaged, but they will also be incredibly flexible on working hours.
You can take a 3-hour lunch, no problem. Instead of tracking your hours, you are paid according to time spent on the platform, calculated in the coding exercises.
Interview Process
Apply using this Ashby form.
If you seem like a good fit, we'll send an async RLHF code review that will take 35 minutes and must be finished within 72 hours of us sending it.
You'll receive credentials to the RLHF platform. We'll then set up a group call to answer any further questions about onboarding with the company.
You'll perform a simulated production-level task (RLHF task) on the platform. This will be your final interview, which will ultimately determine your employment and leveling. Successful completion of this process provides you with an opportunity to work on projects as they become available.

Loom Video
Our Founder/CEO, Gabe Greenberg, created a more in-depth Loom video that we highly recommend you watch! Check it out here: https://www.loom.com/share/5a8972c7fbbf46aaa3f389b2b6391c40
Overview
You’ll join an expert annotation team to create training data for the world's most advanced AI models. No previous AI experience is necessary. You'll get your foot in the door with one of the most prominent players in the AI/LLM space today. We seek software engineers with 3+ years of experience to train large AI language models, helping cutting-edge generative AI models write better code. Projects typically include discrete, highly variable problems that involve engaging with these models as they learn to code. We currently have 200+ roles open!
What Will I Be Doing?
Evaluating the quality of AI-generated code, including human-readable summaries of your rationale
Solve coding problems, writing functional and efficient code
Writing robust test cases to confirm code works efficiently and effectively
We asked the technical project manager to go into even more detail and this is how he answered: It is solving coding challenges, creating instructions to help others, reviewing the code before it goes into the model, and there's a ton of variety in the projects. We have everything from ""Which piece of Verilog code is better?"" to ""Make a full mobile application using this chatbot, and improve the chatbot's responses afterward to make it faster.""
